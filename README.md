# :open_book: Documentation for Corona Statistics Project

The content of this project is generated with [Compodoc](https://compodoc.app/).

Documentation related to project [Corona Xtreme](https://github.com/eliza3291/corona-statistics)

## :beetle: Bug

Currently Compodoc does not allow to set href when creating the index file.

After creating the documentation from the origin project, user must add `<base href="(baseHrefUrl)/">` in the file `index.html`.
